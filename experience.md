# GitHub Experience

I have generally solid experience with GitHub, having worked on various projects already. My familiarity extends across most general functionalities, including:

- **Version Control**
- **Branching/Merging**
- **Pull Requests and Issues**
- **Markdown/MD**
- **Navigation around the site**

See my profile: [ShortTimeNoSee](https://github.com/ShortTimeNoSee)

As of recent, I do most of my work through a locally cloned repo, which I edit, commit, and push through VS Code.
